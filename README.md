# TamaTracker

A program that, in its basic form, tracks the hunger, happiness and growth progress of a [Tamagotchi ON virtual pet device](https://tamagotchi.fandom.com/wiki/Tamagotchi_On).

_The program is currently in a work in progress state, so there are no public releases yet._

## Planned features

* [ ] Tracking of happiness, hunger and growth progress (by manual user input)
* [ ] Prediction of happiness and hunger decay based on the hunger and happiness decay rates of different Tamagotchi life stages (will require additional research)
* [ ] A tool for building family trees, as well as connecting the ancestry lines between different family trees
