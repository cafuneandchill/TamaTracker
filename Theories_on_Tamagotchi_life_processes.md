# Theories on Tamagotchi ON life processes

## Hunger

### Baby stage

Measurements of Tamagotchi's hunger have been performed. The hunger decay rate is approximately 0.333 bar/min (or 1 bar in 3 min). However, the first measurement is usually less than the rest. That might mean that Tamagotchi has an "internal timer" that counts down to the next hunger bar decay (Tamagotchi "digests" hunger bars one at a time). This "timer" doesn't reset after a feeding session.

Example of hunger measurements (numbers are arbitrary, but close to the actual results)
| Hunger (bars)            | Time periods between measurements |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 6 (start of measurement) | 0 min 0 sec                       |
| 5                        | 2 min 4 sec                       |
| 4                        | 3 min 1 sec                       |
| 3                        | 2 min 59 sec                      |

### Adult stage

## Happiness

### Baby stage

Measurements of Tamagotchi's happiness have been performed. The pet fell asleep during the measurement procedure, so the results may be unreliable, if there is no happiness loss during Tamagotchi sleep. May require more measurements.

Measurements. Initial amount is marked as zero.
| Happiness (bars)         | Time periods between measurements |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0 (start of measurement) | 0 min 0 sec                       |
| -1                       | 14 min 0 sec                      |
| -2                       | 16 min 0 sec                      |

According to the measurements, happiness decay rate is approximately 0.067 bar/min (or 1 bar in 15 min). It is possible that there also exists the same type of "internal timer" that regulates hunger bar decay. However, it is yet to be proven.
